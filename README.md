# Better Remit

**Better Remit** is a no-nonsense, fast and exactly what-you-would-expect remittance comparison tool.

It is powered by the RemitRadar API and provides the latest and the greatest remittance rates at any given moment.

# Features supported
1. Select your source and destination of remittance once, and I promise you won't have to change it again! Every time you come to the site, we will have your source and destination countries pre-populated. (I totally hate it when I have to select the same countries every single time I visit a site!)
2. I love emojis ❤️ - You will see a lot of them in the right places! 🏁
3. Cool looking 😎 responsive UI! Browse the site on 📱, phablet, tablet, 💻, 🖥️ or 📺, I will make sure that the site scales based on your form-factor. Still working on the cool-looking part! 🤔 💭

# Problems with the current remittance comparison tools
1. They are slow.
2. Don't show you the right rates.
3. Sorting options are poor
4. There should be no featured remittance service. The user is wise enough to make the decision.
5. Placing Ads in the wrong places! I am not against ads! I understand the importance of remittance, but ads should not be the primary thing on the page.
6. Bad UI! It is so cluttered, I can't find what I am looking for!
. Find more problems!

# Notes to the User
